In this portfolio project, I took an existing fictional Excel dataset for a coffee company to create a dynamic dashboard. I started by cleaning up the datasets to understand the specific needs of these franchised businesses.

From there, I created calculated fields to further my exploratory analysis and understand the factors that would help the business grow financially. Once I created the necessary calculated fields, I used each of them to create PivotTables in a new Excel sheet.

After creating different PivotTables to analyze sales by location, date, time, and products, I transformed the data into visual graphs and charts to help tell the story that the data was revealing. Lastly, after creating these charts and graphs, I added a Slicer. The Slicer makes the overall dashboard dynamic by allowing users to drill up and down through each of the franchised coffee locations to gain useful insights.
